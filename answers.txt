    What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
    Initial population size: 1000
    Vaccination percentage: 90%
    Name of the virus: Sniffles
    Mortality rate: 0.12
    Reproductive rate of Sniffles was: 0.5
    Total initial infected: 10

    What percentage of the population died from the virus?
    About 13% of the population died from the virus.

    What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
    About 1003% of the population became infected at some point before the virus burnt out.

    Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
    The total times a vaccine saved a sick individual was: 38039

    Total steps: 3
    Total interactions: 121100
    Total people dead: 134
    Total vaccinated: 897
    Total infections: 10033
